- 👋 Hi, I’m Brian
- I'm a Nanotechnology Engineering student at the University of Waterloo
- 👀 I’m interested in hardware, software, and semiconductor engineering.
- 🌱 I’m learning new programming languages and improving my fluency in others.
- 🧠 I'm also learning the fundamentals of nanotechnology, with an interest in its applications in the electrical engineering domain
- 👨‍💻Proficient in Java, Python and currently learning C/C++
- I'm slowly going to build this out with some new projects because I don't like the idea of adding old stuff since they seem somewhat basic compared to what's currently out there
